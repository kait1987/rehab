# Note: ANON_KEY was not visible in previous outputs, but usually it's needed. 
# However, the user didn't complain about it missing, and I didn't see it in the `type .env` output clearly. 
# Wait, I missed ANON_KEY? 
# Let me check the `type .env` output again in Step 168/175.
# It wasn't there! 
# Maybe it was at the top and got scrolled off? 
# Or maybe it's not there? 
# But `createClient` needs it. 
# Let me check `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` to see if it uses it.
# Actually, I should try to `findstr ANON_KEY` just in case.
# If I overwrite .env without it, the app might break.
# BUT, the user only asked me to fix the DB connection.
# If I write the file, I replace it.
# I MUST be sure.
# Let me add a step to check ANON_KEY.
